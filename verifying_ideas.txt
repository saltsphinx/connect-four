create a custom data structure
nodes that connect if theyre adjacent
7 arrays representing the columns, theyre used
to keep tracking of the nodes, and for the users
to choose which column to drop pieces into

only connect nodes if theyre the same color
each node scans its potential 8 surrounding nodes for other nodes, and keeps a tally
so if there are 1 node to the left and 2 to the right, thats a winning
